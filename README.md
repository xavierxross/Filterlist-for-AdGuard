## About ℹ

An aggressive filter-list that consolidates over __120 lists__ for use in AdGuard Home (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome).

* Includes the official **AdGuardSDNSFilter**
* The final blocklist is cleaned, sorted and then duplicates have been removed

It blocks:

* ads, affiliates, analytics, enrichments, widgets and trackers
* crypto-locker, shock, drug, fake, fake news, and ransomware websites
* scam, spam, suspicious, and typosquatting websites
* data miners, invasive telemetry, and phishing websites
* social media junk and various CDNs

> VITAL: The list is very aggressive so please ensure that you add your own "Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow.
e.g: `@@||nexusmods.com^$important`

As of version 2.4 the list is more cleaned up, optimized and better than ever.

Set "Filters update interval" to 1 hour and click the green "Save" button. This list updates sporadically.

## Suggestions 📌

Do you have a new host list you'd like to suggest?

Please first check that the list does not already exist in : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/master/filter_list_URLs.txt

Then create a new GitHub issue with the prefix "[add host list]" if it's new.

## Credits ☺️

Full credit for the actual blocking ability goes to original list creators and maintainers.

Thanks so much for their tireless work! :D
